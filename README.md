## Project Plan â™ŸðŸ’»: 
- In Python you need to install a Python MySQL connector to interact with a MySQL database. pip installs the connector as a third-party module in the currently active   virtual environment. Itâ€™s recommended that you set up an isolated virtual environment for the project along with all the dependencies.
   [ $ pip install mysql-connector-python ]
- To interact with a database, you must first establish a connection with the server. The general workflow of a Python program that interacts with a MySQL-based database is as follows:
  * Connect to the MySQL server.
  * Create a new database.
  * Connect to the newly created or an existing database.
  * Execute a SQL query and fetch results.
  * Inform the database if any changes are made to a table.
  * Close the connection to the MySQL server.
- The first step in interacting with a MySQL server is to establish a connection. To do this, you need connect() from the mysql.connector module.
- This function takes in parameters like host, user, and password and returns a MySQLConnection object. You can receive these credentials as input from the user and   pass them to connect():
